  <h1>Readings</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag On Photography</h2>
  <p>In the beginning of this chapter the author mentions that photographs give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads. This stood out to me because I thought of memories and how we are able to hold certain memories and images in our mind that outline our worlds as we experience them, limited or not. I think the sense of holding the world in our heads already existed before photographs and they are more so a tool for an extension of that. Although, if you are looking at images of someone else’s lived experience does that constitute your world? I thought that was an interesting way to challenge the notion that the author presented.</p>
  <p>A phrase that kept popping into my mind while reading this chapter was the phrase “pic or it didn’t happen” which is now commonly used in casual conversation when asking a friend to show or send you a photo of something. I think it reinforces the idea that unless a moment is captured in photo it dies the moment it ends. The author made some parallel points in this chapter and I think about how now in the era that photos and cameras are so readily available our experiences almost don’t exist if we don’t have photo proof of them that we can look back on or share with someone else. I think this has taken away from experiencing things in the moment and being present as it now feels that we are living and seeing the world through the lens of our smart phone cameras. </p>
  <p>A part of this chapter that I thought was important to reflect on was the point that subjects can be manipulated to reflect the biases of the person who is taking a photo. They are able to leave certain things out or catch the subject in a compromised position which would alter their true appearance. Although this method of manipulating an image can be useful for artistic purposes, it can be extremely dangerous and harmful for images that are used to portray political messages or for legal evidence. I think that as humans when we see something that matches our biases, we rarely stop to consider if what we are seeing is accurate which is why it is important to have media literacy and think through these things. Our biases can be used against us to manipulate something that may not be true.</p>
  <p>I agree with the author in that photographs have become deeply ingrained into our social fabric. One of the examples used in this chapter was parents being deemed as indifferent if they were not to take photographs of their small children. Photos have undoubtedly become an important part of how families document important moments and milestones that occur but I think that saying someone is indifferent if they do not take a photo of someone is unfair. There may be other things that one is more fond of than a photograph or maybe someone may not have access to a camera or the funds to be able to print a photo. Although cameras are more easily accessible now than ever I still believe it to be a privilege to preserve photographs and it is not something everyone has access to still. </p>
  <h2> Nesrine Malik on 'AI Slop'</h2>
  <p>I want to start this reflection off by stating that I believe that AI is undoubtedly a ground breaking tool that has the ability to positively change the way that humans operate. However, I believe that AI has unfortunately become exploitative and that it is being used in improper ways. One of these ways is the common phenomenon that I have witnessed which is people no longer using their own brains or critical thinking skills to come up with solutions or answers to a problem no matter how simple it may be. It has become almost a reflex for people to open up the chatGPT app to ask it a question instead of taking a beat to see if they are able to answer it for themselves. I have seen people asking AI for personal advice or to do their homework for them. My frame of thought is that I believe that AI should be a tool and not an end all be all. For example, if you are writing a paper I think that is may be acceptable to use AI to help you possibly organize your (own) ideas and maybe help you come up with an outline for your paper but I strongly disagree with the idea of using AI to regurgitate an already existing idea and trying to pass if off as your own.I strongly believe that this is why our country has seen a decline in intellect and academic scores. At this point, I think it is better to have ideas or a piece of work that is your own and imperfect than using AI to make something for you and having it be “perfect”. In this article in particular the focus is on AI being used in the media for politics. To be frank, I think this is abhorrent. Our politicians are now using AI, something that undoubtedly affects our environment and by way of that our underprivileged communities, to create insensitive memes in poor taste about their bigoted policies is insane to me. It's like adding insult to injury a hundred times over. I do not think that our official government pages should be allowed to post memes at all and that there should be some regulations around this. I agree with the article that this has caused us to become desensitized to the information that is being presented to us due to it coming in the shape of cartoon images and poorly made jokes. The focus has now become the disgusting meme and not what the meme is actually informing us of. I think that AI makes it entirely too easy for people to doctor images or create brand new images that portray false information and as the article mentions it becomes easy for people with poor media literacy to believe this false information when it fits their already existing biases. With this becoming something that is occurring more and more frequently I think that media literacy classes will be something that has to be implemented into regular school curriculum in the future. All in all, I think that something that was meant to benefit us has now become our societal demise. </p>
