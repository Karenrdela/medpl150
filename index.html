<p>Finding the beauty in the unexpected drives everything that I do. As someone who was born and raised in the grit on the Bronx, searching for pockets of pretty where one may not think they are has been a driving force in my life and why I wish to be a media maker . Growing up in the midst of the dial-up, internet and social media era has cultivated in me a love of media and all of its powers. It has been the needle sowing the stitch of my life and I have not known one without all the mediums of media we know today. Some of my favorite forms of media are books for how they allow stories to play out in our minds, music due to how it can trigger emotion, and film for all the intricate ways that ideas and visual stories can be displayed. As a lover of the internet and media I have grown an interest in the technical side of creating websites. An interesting concept that I wish to learn more about is UX/UI. Although technical I believe there is an art to creating web pages and apps that are not only visually appealing but easy to navigate. Growing up as a first generation American in the era of the internet, through the eyes of my mother I have experienced the difference that knowing how to use and navigate the internet can make in someone's life. Perfection lies between the beautiful and the functional.</p>
