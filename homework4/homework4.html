  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For my first image I focused on changes in climate that have been caused by global warming, specifically one that has been alarming to me as a born and raised new yorker who has lived in this city for almost 30 years, which is New York City now being considered as having a subtropical climate. The elements that I used were a photo of the NYC streets that I took while I was on my way to class and a photo of a palm tree as well as a photo of a tropical rainstorm that I found on Pexels. I layered these elements to incorporate them in a way that highlights the unnaturalness of our current climate based on the region that we are in. It seems bizarre to have palm trees smack dab in the middle of Park Avenue just how it feels bizarre to experience such extreme humidity in a city that is in the northeastern region of the US. </p>
  <p>For my second image I focused on the female body and how much beauty and power it holds. To depict this I used a background that was a photo of a universe that I got on Pexels, on top of this I layered a Romanesque sculpture of a naked woman that I also got on Pexels along with various different photos of flowers that I took while visiting a botanical garden. I chose these photos and their arrangement because it was a literal take of how women are the center of the universe and hold so much power within them and how beautiful they are. Their beauty is depicted in the flowers surrounding them. I chose flowers because they are often seen as a symbol of beauty in nature.</p>
