  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>This assignment was interesting because we got to see how the usage of simple shapes when joined together can create more intricate forms, in this case an eye. When working on this assignment I decided to go with an eye that, in my opinion, exhibits the emotion of fear, sadness or pain in a subtle way. I did that by not centering the placement of the pupil but instead making it go off into the side. When working with a design that is so simple like this one, small choices like that one can make a big difference such as adding emotion or giving a design a specific vibe. When choosing the colors for this assignment I focused on making them somewhat realistic to what a human eye could look like. I used different shades of a brownish color to illustrate the skin around the eye. There was a lighter shade of that brownish color that was less saturated and that was used to illustrate the eyeball whereas a complimentary shade of blue was used for the irises. Although I did use a photo of my own eye to help me trace this design my own eyes are not blue but obviously, it is still a realistic color to use for irises. The pupil part was easy to choose and was simply a black color. I decided to use a photo of my own eye to help me with this illustration because I thought it would be fun to see how they looked in this almost cartoonish illustration.</p>
