<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Image 1</h2>

  <img src="homework2/hw2pic1.jpg" width="50%">
  <p>This is an image that I had already visualized in my mind when I set out to take photos for this assignment. In my opinion, there are few things that are quintessentially representative of  New York City as the image of the Sabrett hot dog umbrella that is used at stands all over the city. This image combines that with the Halal food trucks that we all know and love. To me, this image captures an integral cornerstone of the food scene in NYC. Visually, I really enjoyed the original contrast of light and darkness in the image before editing. I ended up lightening those dark tones for the sake of the assignment but I truly prefer the raw and original version of this image. The colorful LED lights were the perfect contrast against the darkness of the evening. Something that was a pleasant surprise was the man in my photo, when I was taking it I didn’t notice that he was in frame as I thought I was capturing him just casually working. I cropped the image to capture the main focal points which were the LED lights for their sparkling contrast against the darkness, the Sabrett umbrella for its iconic brand presence, the man waving which accidentally became my subject, and the leaves from the trees above that also provided a nice contrast due to their dark appearance against the sky that was still slightly illuminated by the setting sun. To tie everything together there is also the “I <3 NY” sticker smack dab in the middle. Unlike the other image I used for this assignment, I actually love this one and hope to be able to capture more like it.</p>
