  <h2>Susan Songtag on Photography</h2>
<p>In the beginning of this chapter the author mentions that photographs give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads. This stood out to me because I thought of memories and how we are able to hold certain memories and images in our mind that outline our worlds as we experience them, limited or not. I think the sense of holding the world in our heads already existed before photographs and they are more so a tool for an extension of that. Although, if you are looking at images of someone else’s lived experience does that constitute your world? I thought that was an interesting way to challenge the notion that the author presented. </p>
  <p>A phrase that kept popping into my mind while reading this chapter was the phrase “pic or it didn’t happen” which is now commonly used in casual conversation when asking a friend to show or send you a photo of something. I think it reinforces the idea that unless a moment is captured in photo it dies the moment it ends. The author made some parallel points in this chapter and I think about how now in the era that photos and cameras are so readily available our experiences almost don’t exist if we don’t have photo proof of them that we can look back on or share with someone else. I think this has taken away from experiencing things in the moment and being present as it now feels that we are living and seeing the world through the lens of our smart phone cameras.
