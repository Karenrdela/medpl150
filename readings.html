  <h2>Susan Sontag On Photography</h2>
  <p>In the beginning of this chapter the author mentions that photographs give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads. This stood out to me because I thought of memories and how we are able to hold certain memories and images in our mind that outline our worlds as we experience them, limited or not. I think the sense of holding the world in our heads already existed before photographs and they are more so a tool for an extension of that. Although, if you are looking at images of someone else’s lived experience does that constitute your world? I thought that was an interesting way to challenge the notion that the author presented.</p>
  <p>A phrase that kept popping into my mind while reading this chapter was the phrase “pic or it didn’t happen” which is now commonly used in casual conversation when asking a friend to show or send you a photo of something. I think it reinforces the idea that unless a moment is captured in photo it dies the moment it ends. The author made some parallel points in this chapter and I think about how now in the era that photos and cameras are so readily available our experiences almost don’t exist if we don’t have photo proof of them that we can look back on or share with someone else. I think this has taken away from experiencing things in the moment and being present as it now feels that we are living and seeing the world through the lens of our smart phone cameras. </p>
  <p>A part of this chapter that I thought was important to reflect on was the point that subjects can be manipulated to reflect the biases of the person who is taking a photo. They are able to leave certain things out or catch the subject in a compromised position which would alter their true appearance. Although this method of manipulating an image can be useful for artistic purposes, it can be extremely dangerous and harmful for images that are used to portray political messages or for legal evidence. I think that as humans when we see something that matches our biases, we rarely stop to consider if what we are seeing is accurate which is why it is important to have media literacy and think through these things. Our biases can be used against us to manipulate something that may not be true.</p>
  <p>I agree with the author in that photographs have become deeply ingrained into our social fabric. One of the examples used in this chapter was parents being deemed as indifferent if they were not to take photographs of their small children. Photos have undoubtedly become an important part of how families document important moments and milestones that occur but I think that saying someone is indifferent if they do not take a photo of someone is unfair. There may be other things that one is more fond of than a photograph or maybe someone may not have access to a camera or the funds to be able to print a photo. Although cameras are more easily accessible now than ever I still believe it to be a privilege to preserve photographs and it is not something everyone has access to still. </p>
