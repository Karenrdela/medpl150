  <h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>For this assignment I decided to go with a photo of some windows on a building I saw while I was on Park Avenue. When I captured this image I was on my way to class, heading from my office to the subway station. I think that I subconsciously chose a photo of a building for this assignment because I work in real estate and look at photos of buildings or apartments all day. I also enjoyed how neat the windows looked. The overall look of the building in the original photo is what I like to call luxe architecture. There is just something about these beautiful, and often older, brick buildings that you see in New York City that make them feel grand and like they have rich, deep history. Now I didn’t actually take the time to research the building itself but that is what I felt when I looked at it. When working on this assignment I wanted to capture how the windowpanes looked angular due to how tall the building was and the angle that I took the photo from. I thought that it was cool to transform this very grand, old money aesthetic of the original building to an almost cartoonish illustration. When choosing my color triad, I chose one that had some earth tones but also fun pops of color such as the purplish pink that I used for the window pane. For the bricks, I chose the most neutral color which was a sort of olive green shade because it was as close as I was going to get to the color of the bricks. The windows are blue because, again, I feel like it matched up to that cartoonish idea of what the color of windows or glass would be.</p>
