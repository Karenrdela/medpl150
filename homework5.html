  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For my first image I chose a simple shape and simple color to incorporate into my design. I had the idea to use a rectangle to act as a censor block for this image because it incorporated the women’s body, a thing that we so often witness censorship of in the media. In order to not fully feed into that cliche I also used the block to sensor the woman’s eyes. I did this so that no “distracting” parts of the body were visible and viewers could focus on solely the form of the body. To me this image illustrates how we do not need explicit imagery to show how beautiful a woman’s form can be.</p>
  <p>For my second image I created a nine point star shape that I used to illustrate the BOOM sound that you hear when there is thunder going on outside. Since this illustration/collage is representative of New York’s new classification of a subtropical climate I wanted to not only incorporate things that would stimulate the viewers sense of sight but also things that could inadvertently stimulate their other senses such as their hearing even though the image is silent. I chose the dark, almost golden yellow color because that is the color I typically associate with lightning bolts which contribute to the overall scene being displayed. It was difficult to choose where to put these stars because I didn’t want the image to feel so symmetrical and balanced which is why I decided to go with an odd number of stars.</p>
