  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>For this assignment I went around and asked all of my coworkers where they lived. The options that were given to me after their answers were the following: The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Staten Island and New Jersey. This worked well because there was not an influx of options and allowed me to present this data in a concise manner. When choosing which type of graph to make I chose a bar graph because I felt that it would present the data to audiences in the most simple, easy to read, form. Although my survey was not filled with extensive questions and therefore did not yield extensive data, I tried to make the graph more visually appealing with the use of different colors for each data bar and different fonts. I also used a black and white background photo of the Hudson River. I chose a photo of the Hudson River because at first I wanted to use a photo of the New York City skyline but found that it was too distracting with all the different colors and words presented on the graph. I also made a stylistic choice by choosing whichever background photo I went with to be black and white. I chose this because I felt like it could provide an interesting background for the data while still not detracting viewers from the information that is being presented to them. The black and white background allows the rest of the colors to pop and it will be easier to see what the distinction is with each different color bar.</p>
