<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Image 2</h2>

  <img src="homework2/hw2pic2.jpg" width="50%">
  <p>Something I struggled on with this image is how dark it was outside when I captured it. I wanted the letters to be more visible. When editing this image I made it so that the tone became brighter and the letters were able to pop more. This image is the type of image I capture whenever I am out wandering and see something random that I like or when a message sticks with me. While the composition of the image is fairly simple and plain, I like that the words themselves are the focal point. This image is in stark contrast to the other image that I chose for this assignment which has a lot more contrast with lighting and color. I think that is a fair reflection of the images that typically capture my attention. Even though the background is not busy and lacks color I still see something interesting there. I believe that the person who wrote down these words intended for the message to continue to be shared and that is what was going through my mind when I was capturing the image. This also reminds me of the “aesthetic” type images that are frequently used on platforms such as Pinterest or Tumblr. To be honest, this is not my favorite photo that I’ve taken and made me want to work more on my “eye” with a camera. I want to be able to capture more compelling images that may not be as straight forward as this one was. </p>
