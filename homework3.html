  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>My main focus for this assignment seemed to be lights. I think a large part of that had to do with the fact that I took these photos as it was getting darker outside and the lights were of more contrast and stood out to me more than anything else. For the first part of the assignment involving depth of field I went with a photo of a light that illuminated one of the entrances of the North building of our campus. I thought that the entryway and lighting made it look like an old time-y castle. I also liked how there was even more contrast with the light for the shallow depth of field image example and I tried to emulate that when creating the field blur. I wanted the light fixture to be the main focal point of the image and blurred everything but that. With the second part of the assignment I used overexposure to create a stark effect with the first image which was of a garbage truck in traffic. With this image there were a lot of different elements such as the different lights, people and cars which made it feel natural to provide more chaos per se, with the stark effect. The second image was of the light peeking through someone's window. I used underexposure to make this image a lot darker and to give it a feeling of warmth or mystery depending on how you look at it. I did this because this image made me wonder what was going on in the room that this window belonged to and I wanted to evoke that same feeling for others who see this image. </p>
