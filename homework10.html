  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>Okay, first of all, this assignment was actually fun! At first, I will admit I was a bit intimidated but once I started mapping out what I wanted my interactive story to be about and started thinking about the destinations and images that I’d be using, everything just kind of flowed together from there! This interactive story is inspired by me and the paths I usually go on at the end of my work day. Most of the time those paths typically land me in class or at home, but every now and then I get to treat myself and go shopping or even window shopping which I think can be just as fun! The locations that I used are realistic and accurate as to the direction that I go in to reach the final destinations of the story. My favorite part was coming up with little captions and titles for each page because I crack myself up and think I’m funnier than I probably am. I wanted whoever was clicking through this story to smile or maybe even laugh at the silly phrases or photos used in my story. For my images I used a mixture of things such as a real life selfie that I took on a night out (sorry, that wasn’t me after work, I usually look way more tired than that), I also used images that I searched up on Google, and the photo used on the page telling the viewer that they have to go to class is currently one of my favorite memes that I have stored in my phone. I really enjoyed making this and I hope you enjoy the journey!</p>
