  <h1>Readings</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag On Photography</h2>
  <p>In the beginning of this chapter the author mentions that photographs give us the sense that we can hold the whole world in our heads. This stood out to me because I thought of memories and how we are able to hold certain memories and images in our mind that outline our worlds as we experience them, limited or not. I think the sense of holding the world in our heads already existed before photographs and they are more so a tool for an extension of that. Although, if you are looking at images of someone else’s lived experience does that constitute your world? I thought that was an interesting way to challenge the notion that the author presented.</p>
  <p>A phrase that kept popping into my mind while reading this chapter was the phrase “pic or it didn’t happen” which is now commonly used in casual conversation when asking a friend to show or send you a photo of something. I think it reinforces the idea that unless a moment is captured in photo it dies the moment it ends. The author made some parallel points in this chapter and I think about how now in the era that photos and cameras are so readily available our experiences almost don’t exist if we don’t have photo proof of them that we can look back on or share with someone else. I think this has taken away from experiencing things in the moment and being present as it now feels that we are living and seeing the world through the lens of our smart phone cameras. </p>
  <p>A part of this chapter that I thought was important to reflect on was the point that subjects can be manipulated to reflect the biases of the person who is taking a photo. They are able to leave certain things out or catch the subject in a compromised position which would alter their true appearance. Although this method of manipulating an image can be useful for artistic purposes, it can be extremely dangerous and harmful for images that are used to portray political messages or for legal evidence. I think that as humans when we see something that matches our biases, we rarely stop to consider if what we are seeing is accurate which is why it is important to have media literacy and think through these things. Our biases can be used against us to manipulate something that may not be true.</p>
  <p>I agree with the author in that photographs have become deeply ingrained into our social fabric. One of the examples used in this chapter was parents being deemed as indifferent if they were not to take photographs of their small children. Photos have undoubtedly become an important part of how families document important moments and milestones that occur but I think that saying someone is indifferent if they do not take a photo of someone is unfair. There may be other things that one is more fond of than a photograph or maybe someone may not have access to a camera or the funds to be able to print a photo. Although cameras are more easily accessible now than ever I still believe it to be a privilege to preserve photographs and it is not something everyone has access to still. </p>
  <h2> Nesrine Malik on 'AI Slop'</h2>
  <p>I want to start this reflection off by stating that I believe that AI is undoubtedly a ground breaking tool that has the ability to positively change the way that humans operate. However, I believe that AI has unfortunately become exploitative and that it is being used in improper ways. One of these ways is the common phenomenon that I have witnessed which is people no longer using their own brains or critical thinking skills to come up with solutions or answers to a problem no matter how simple it may be. It has become almost a reflex for people to open up the chatGPT app to ask it a question instead of taking a beat to see if they are able to answer it for themselves. I have seen people asking AI for personal advice or to do their homework for them. My frame of thought is that I believe that AI should be a tool and not an end all be all. For example, if you are writing a paper I think that is may be acceptable to use AI to help you possibly organize your (own) ideas and maybe help you come up with an outline for your paper but I strongly disagree with the idea of using AI to regurgitate an already existing idea and trying to pass if off as your own.I strongly believe that this is why our country has seen a decline in intellect and academic scores. At this point, I think it is better to have ideas or a piece of work that is your own and imperfect than using AI to make something for you and having it be “perfect”. In this article in particular the focus is on AI being used in the media for politics. To be frank, I think this is abhorrent. Our politicians are now using AI, something that undoubtedly affects our environment and by way of that our underprivileged communities, to create insensitive memes in poor taste about their bigoted policies is insane to me. It's like adding insult to injury a hundred times over. I do not think that our official government pages should be allowed to post memes at all and that there should be some regulations around this. I agree with the article that this has caused us to become desensitized to the information that is being presented to us due to it coming in the shape of cartoon images and poorly made jokes. The focus has now become the disgusting meme and not what the meme is actually informing us of. I think that AI makes it entirely too easy for people to doctor images or create brand new images that portray false information and as the article mentions it becomes easy for people with poor media literacy to believe this false information when it fits their already existing biases. With this becoming something that is occurring more and more frequently I think that media literacy classes will be something that has to be implemented into regular school curriculum in the future. All in all, I think that something that was meant to benefit us has now become our societal demise. </p>
  <h2> Motherhood in Crisis</h2>
  <p>I chose to read this story in comparison to the other ones because I was immediately drawn to the issue that it is highlighting. Living in a western country, and especially with that country being the United States with all of its convoluted politics, racism and propaganda, we are always being fed negative information and ideas about countries like Sierra Leone. This is harmful for obvious reasons but I think the most harmful part of it all is that these things become so sensationalized that they almost don't feel real and end up getting ignored a lot of the time. I truly believe that this is one of the things that contributes to stories and cases like Heela’s going unnoticed and unsolved. Something that was so jarring about this story is that because of how innocent and young she was, Heela did not even seem to understand what was happening to her or her body until it was too late and she was already pregnant. Society often treats black girls and women as if they were promiscuous due to racist stereotypes which leads to these same women and girls being afraid to speak out on injustices committed against them and having to deal with the long term repercussions such as trauma and in this case, pregnancy that will alter the trajectory of the victim's life for the rest of her life. The story also touched on something that is very real and affects women all over the world, even first world countries such as the United States, and that is a lack of access to healthcare, specifically the access to safe abortions. In the story, Heela tells her friend she was thinking of an abortion but doesn’t know how she would do it and her friend is afraid because she has heard that a lot of girls die when getting an abortion. It is so unfortunate that women lack resources to help them when they face injustices and are faced with means that may cost them their lives. The rules, regulations and laws that make it so that women don't have access to these necessities are often decided on by men who have their own preconceived notions and lack of knowledge about what an abortion actually is and how it can be life saving. These same men fail to make laws and regulations that would be effective is stopping sexual assault. Heela is able to find some community resources to help her with her health and also with her case once she reports the assault to the authorities but unfortunately this is not the case for many women. The most infuriating part for me as I was reading, aside from the horrible sexual assault, is that Heela now has to deal with this enormous life change while the person that did this to her is able to run and likely restart a new life somewhere else where no one will know of what he did. Women around the world are constantly failed by the men around them.</p>
  <h2>The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</h2>
  <p>I want to start off by saying that this was a very difficult article to get through, at least for me. This was due to the sheer amount of political war jargon that the article was riddled with. However, I did appreciate learning about something I might not have learned about otherwise. The first thing that caught my eye was the initial animation, this animation was a sort of glowing light that was pulsing/flashing on the background of the page. This animation caught my interest because the tempo of it reminded me of the same tempo that is associated with the emergency nuclear alarm siren. I think that the color choices that were made for this animation and others throughout the article that I will address later on were effective in really adding to the feeling of panic that hearing something like that would cause. One of the first points in the actual text of the article that stood out to me was the mention of the dogma of deterrence. This concept stood out to me because it perfectly illustrates the fear that the United States expects for other countries to live in. I think that it is absurd for this to be the philosophy that our government and army use to shape their strategies instead of making real efforts for there to be peace for the safety of all their citizens. In my opinion, you cannot base your safety or the safety of your constituents on whether or not another country fears your retaliation, that will only get you so far until they feel like they have the power to overcome you. I also think that it is ridiculous that these countries, ours included, believe that having nuclear weapons is not for winning a nuclear war but for preventing them. To be completely candid, that makes absolutely zero sense. If all countries were banned from being able to possess nuclear weapons then that would eliminate the possibility of nuclear wars happening. This almost reminds me of our country's gun control problem and how our government officials refuse to acknowledge that there would be less mass shootings and gun violence if people had less/no access to guns. It’s honestly almost comical that this is something that the officials that we trust to keep us safe truly believe. There was a question in the article that asked: “If deterrence fails, how is it possible to reduce the risk of one attack escalating into a global catastrophe?” My answer to this is that you cannot. Like I mentioned previously, deterrence is not a viable option to ensure that these attacks won’t happen, the only way that we can avoid a man made catastrophe like one that would be caused by nuclear weapons is to eliminate the weapons themselves, the fact that governments are able to possess weapons that would cause this much destruction and peril is insane. It seems like the governments that do possess these weapons are constantly on edge and walking on eggshells with each other, constantly trying to gain insight on the amount of weapons that the other may have to prepare themselves for the worst. This is such an antiquated way of operating our governments and takes away from the very real issues that governments could be focused on instead that would genuinely help the people that they work for. </p>
