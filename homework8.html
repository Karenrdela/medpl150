  <h2>Reflection</h2>
  <p>For my first gif I had to continue working on the eye illustration that I previously created and was tasked with making it blink. Honestly, at first I was getting a bit frustrated because my eye didn’t originally have an eyelid structure so I was having difficulty with making it blink and have something fold over the pupil and then I remembered that I could just make an eyelid which is what I ended up doing. Once I got over that hurdle it was decently easy to figure out how to make each frame so that it can look somewhat cohesive, I must say it ended up looking better than I expected (for me).</p>
  <p>For the second gif I was having trouble deciding which image I wanted to use so I ended up just using an image of a very cute dog jumping. With the puppet warp tool it can be difficult to make the animation look natural because as it says in the name, this tool can warp the image. The trick to this ended up being making very small changes to each layer so that when each one was turned into a frame things flowed a lot better and smoother. I enjoyed this assignment and learning how to do this. I think out of all the assignments so far this is the one that I can see myself possibly using the most in the future just for fun and to create funny memes or gifs with my friends.</p>
